General NOTE: It is important to follow the structure of the layout that we provided, including placement of all elements. The cropping of the images, the font-size and font-family are LESS important, i.e. do not have to be 100% as the layout. 

Focus on how the articles/items are positioned in the 2 versions (for example: the 3 articles/items layout in the desktop version vs. 2 article layout in the mobile version, as well as the banners that are ONLY visible in the mobile version)
